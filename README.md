# portfolio-project

Calliope has asked us to submit breif bios and portfolios so that she can update the local library!

This is my personal website! It contains the following:

1. A "Home" page giving a breif description about me
2. An "About Me" page that tells you what I like to do outside of work
3. A "Portfolio" page that lists my projects and gives you access to them

To create this, I made and included the following files:

1. Index.html: contains the coding for the Home page
2. About.html: contains the coding for the About Me page
3. Portfolio.html: contaisn the coding for the Portfolio page
4. Style.css: contains the code for the style of my website (ie: font, color, layout, etc)
5. Script.js: contains the code for a simple print statement "Hello World!"
6. 3 Images that I used in my website

I worked on different features on different branches:

1. Main Branch: worked on the index.html file - links to the Home page
2. About Branch: worked on the about.html file - links to the About Me page
3. Portfolio Branch: worked on the portfolio.html file - links to the Portfolio page
   _Note: all three of these html files are linked to style.css and script.js_
