    <h2>My life outside of work</h2>
    <h3>Punching above my weight class</h3>
    <p>
      Boxing is more than just a sport; it's a journey of self-discovery and
      empowerment. Through rigorous training and intense matches, I’ve learned
      discipline, resilience, and the importance of pushing my limits. The
      thrill of competition and the camaraderie within the boxing community fuel
      my passion for the ring.

    <h3>Eating my way through Los Angeles</h3>
    <p>
      After living in the Bay Area for 15 years, I was spoiled for choices in
      the culinary world. Los Angeles boasts a diverse and exciting culinary
      scene, and I love testing it out. My adventures take me through the city’s
      vibrant food landscape, where I explore everything from trendy food trucks
      to hidden gems. Each dish tells a story, and I relish the opportunity to
      discover and share the flavors that make LA a food lover’s paradise.
